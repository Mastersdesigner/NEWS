      "TOUCH THE SKY WITH GLORY" PM NARENDRA MODI WELCOMES RAFALE FIGHTER JETS

      With a Sanskrit tweet referring to the responsibility to defend one's country being paramount, Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed the landing of Rafale fighter jets in Ambala. The tweet from the Prime Minister came just moments after the first batch of five Rafale Jets landed at Ambala on Wednesday afternoon after covering 7,000 km in flight after Tuesday's departure from France. There is no greater blessing than to defend the country; it is a noble deed to protect the nation, and the greatest Yagna is to protect the nation. Beyond this, there is none. Of glory, hit the moon. Welcome, ‚Äù says a rough version of his tweet. The tweet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi also refers to the motto carved on the Indian Air Force insignia which says in Sanskrit' Nav sparsham deeptam 'or' touch the sky with glory'

      PM MODI INAUGURATES 3 GUJARAT PROJECTS FOR PRODUCTION

    <p align="responsive">
      Three projects in Gujarat, one each related to farmers' welfare, healthcare and tourism growth, were inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi via video link from New Delhi on Saturday. "Kisan Suryodaya Yojana" was initiated by PM Modi to provide day-time electricity for irrigation and farming purposes to the farmers in the province. He also opened the Paediatric Heart Hospital at the UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre in Ahmedabad, established by the State Department of Health and Family Welfare with an investment of approximately 470 crore. In addition, a 2.3 km-long ropeway project was launched on Mount Girnar near Junagadh city, a major pilgrimage site in Ahmedabad. As the longest temple ropeway in Asia, it is being touted. PM Modi blasted the opposition during his speech over the delay in finishing the ropeway scheme. "If the Girnar ropeway had not created barriers, it would not have been stalled for too many years. Residents and visitors should have been able to profit from it a long time ago,"

      PM MODI TO ADDRESS THE COUNTRY AT 11AM REGARDING "MANN KI BAAT"

    <p align="responsive">
      During the 70th edition of his monthly radio show, Mann Ki Baat, at 11 am on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the country. Earlier this month, PM Modi invited ideas and feedback from people on his social media pages about Mann Ki Baat 's topics where he confronts the country over a variety of issues. By writing to him using NaMo or MyGov App or by capturing their messages by calling 1800-11-7800, the Prime Minister tweeted to invite people to give their input. The last day for the recommendations to be submitted was October 23. PM Modi had strongly defended the laws introduced by his government in the previous edition of Mann ki Baat, which came shortly after the passage of the farm bills, and said they would help farmers by allowing them the right to choose where they wanted to sell their produce as well as buyers by keeping middlemen out of agricultural trade.
