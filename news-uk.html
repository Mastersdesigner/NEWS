      Julie Williams, 58, and her son David, 32, were found on successive days in separate flats in Coventry. In Newbold Comyn, Leamington Spa, the body of Nicole McGregor, 31, was subsequently found in woodland. Anthony Russell, 38, of Riley Square, Coventry, was arrested on Friday in Staffordshire and will appear in Birmingham on Monday before magistrates. He is also charged with offences linked to an attempted car-jacking and an accident that took place on Wednesday in Leamington, West Midlands Police said. For the three persons, post-mortem results were inconclusive, the force added, and further testing would be carried out. Ms McGregor 's family said: "We want to thank people for their kind wishes. Nicole will be deeply missed. At this tough moment, we want to be left alone to grieve. "Our thoughts are with the families of Julie, David and Nicole as they come to terms with the devastating circumstances of their deaths," Det Insp Jim Mahon said. "Our work continues and I will encourage anybody who has not yet spoken to us to contact us with details."

      IN REACTION TO AN ANTISEMITISM INVESTIGATION , 'JERMY CORBYN' SUSPENDED THE LABOUR PARTY

      As a teenager, 55 years ago, Jeremy Corbyn joined Labour and led the party into the last general election. But the Islington North MP, awaiting an investigation, has now been suspended. We can't tell you what the conclusion is going to be, but we can explain why the group argues that the decision was made ... Labour has been dogged with accusations of anti-Jewish bigotry by some of its members, often on social media, since 2016-a year since Mr Corbyn was elected leader. Anti-Semitic violence is against the law, and an inquiry into Labour's treatment of allegations about the actions of some of its supporters was opened in May last year by the agency that governs human rights and equality in the UK. Under Jeremy Corbyn 's leadership of the opposition, the Commission placed some of the blame on "significant failings." But it was not the report's finding that led to the dismissal of the former leader, Labor says.

      DOGS ARE THE OLDEST FRIENDS TO HUMANS. DNA REVEALS
    </b>
    </h4>
    <p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4F09/production/_115133202_002716794.jpg" width="60%" class="responsive"></p>
    <p align="responsive">
      A dog DNA research has shown that our "true mate" in the world of animals can also be our oldest one. The research indicates that the domestication of dogs can be dated back 11,000 years, to the close of the last Ice Age. This suggests that, prior to all other recognised animals, dogs were domesticated. At this time, our canine companions were common in the northern hemisphere and had already broken into five distinct forms. Traces of these ancient ancestral breeds exist today in the Americas, Asia , Africa and Oceania, amid the expansion of European dogs during the colonial period. The thesis fills up some of the gaps in our close animal companions' natural history. Dr. Pontus Skoglund, co-author of the study and group leader of the London Crick Institute's Ancient Genomics Laboratory, told BBC News: "Dogs are very special in being this really unusual phenomenon when you think about it, when all humans were already hunter collectors, they domesticate what is really a wild carnivorous thing."
