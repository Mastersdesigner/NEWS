       "COVID: PM WARNS" twice as bad about virus deaths as spring
    </b>
    </h4>

      He would say there is "no solution" in a Parliamentary speech as he tries to secure approval for the proposed four-week lockdown across England. But before telling people to stay at home, Mr Johnson will clarify that he was "right to explore every possible alternative." Labour said that it would accept the lockdown, but criticised the delay. At a Downing Street news conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson declared that from Thursday, stringent steps would be enforced across England, shutting bars, shops, gyms, non-essential stores and places of worship. However, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick confirmed that moving house will still be allowed during the restrictions, adding that removals firms, estate agents and tradespeople can continue to work but must follow Covid safety guidelines. In his address to MPs, the prime minister is expected to say: "Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave. "Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level."Mr Johnson is expected to acknowledge that some MPs believe "we should have reached this decision earlier", but will defend his earlier decision to try to control the virus with "strong local action and strong local leadership".

      COVID-19: PM DECLARES ENGLAND'S FOUR-WEEK LOCKOUT

      He said Christmas could be "completely different," but he hoped it would mean that families might unite now to take action. From Thursday, bars, hotels, gyms and non-essential stores would have to close for four weeks, he added. Yet schools, colleges and universities will remain available, unlike the constraints in spring. The constraints will be relaxed after 2 December and regions will go back to the tiered system, he added. At a Downing Street news conference, the prime minister said he was "truly, truly sorry" for the effect on companies, but said the furlough scheme would be extended through November to pay 80 percent of employee salaries. "No rational prime minister" should disregard estimates that indicated "several thousand a day" deaths would hit, with a "peak in mortality" greater than the world saw in April, Mr. Johnson said. He said hospitals would run out of room in weeks, also in the south-west of England, where cases are among the lowest. According to Mr Johnson, "Doctors and nurses would be forced to select the patients to handle, who would get oxygen and who would not, who would survive and who would die."

      COVID IN SCOTLAND: LATEST GEOGRAPHICAL FIVE-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS GO LIVE

      There are five tiers of the provincial structure, but each of the country's 32 local authorities was originally ranked between levels 1 and 3. People have been advised to allow only necessary journeys beyond their council area under level 3 restrictions. The introduction comes despite continuing demands for clarification on the expansion of the furlough programme from the Treasury. A postcode tracker has been introduced to avoid any misunderstanding at the local levels, so that residents can review the laws that take effect from 06:00. Ms Sturgeon said the new system would make it easier to react rapidly and flexibly, especially in places where the virus has spread. "She warned:" No one wishes to see stricter controls, but people should be confident that we would not refuse to do so if we need to bring in place the safeguards that come with higher standards. "I also advise us to comply with two main national prohibitions by not mixing inside our homes with other households and by not commuting to or from any part of the world at level 3 unless it is completely required." In level 3 districts, senior school pupils will also now be expected to wear face covers in class, not only in communal areas. Latest statistics on Sunday showed that in the previous 24 hours, there were 1,148 new Covid cases-7 percent of those checked-and six more deaths. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (443 new cases), NHS Lanarkshire (253) and NHS Lothian (140) remain the big hotspots in the health board 's overview of good outcomes.
