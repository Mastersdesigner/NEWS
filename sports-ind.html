      MS Dhoni-led Chennai Super Kings had a comfortable victory over Kings XI Punjab in their last league in the ongoing Indian Premier League on Sunday. Dhoni had brought joy to many cricket fans, declaring earlier in the day that he was "definitely not" retiring from IPL and will be back in action for CSK next season. After an emphatic victory, Harsha Bhogle mocked Dhoni and told him that it was a good thing that the CSK skipper had some jerseys left, as they all sneaked one out of him. "Nice to see you've got some jerseys left because I saw that they're all stealing one off of you," Bhogle said at the Sheik Zayed Stadium post-match presentation. Dhoni responded desperately that maybe the players thought he was going to retire. "Maybe they thought I was going to retire. You know ... retired from international cricket, and maybe I'm going to retire from the shortest style, too."

Dhoni also said that since the next IPL is just a few months away, he is looking forward to planning for it, given there is no lockdown in place.
