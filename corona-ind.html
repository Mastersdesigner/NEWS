      In the past 24 hours, India has reported 36,469 new coronavirus cases and 488 deaths. In October, the nation experienced a sharp decline in the number of cases and deaths every day. The country posted the lowest daily growth in cases in over three months on Monday. Since new cases were introduced today, the country's cumulative tally of Covid-19 cases rose to 79,46,429 cases. Nevertheless, millions of individuals in the nation who were initially afflicted with the virus have healed. As most of the people who were affected earlier have healed, India now has just over six lakh active cases. After a drop of 27,860 in the last 24 hours, the nation currently has 6,25,857 active incidents. Though 72,01,070 after treatment is discharged. Since healing in the last 24 hours, more than 63,842 people were discharged. After 488 new deaths have been recorded in the last 24 hours, the overall death rate in the world is inching closer to 1,20,000.

      FIRST COVID DEATH CONFIRMED BY MIZORAM; DELHI SCHOOLS TO REMAIN SHUT UNTIL THE NEXT ORDER

      Due to the COVID-19 situation, all schools in Delhi will continue to be closed until further orders are issued, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced on Wednesday. Parents are still not in support of reopening colleges, Sisodia said at a press conference online. "We continue to get input from parents that they are very worried about whether reopening schools is healthy. It isn't that. Wherever schools have reopened, cases of COVID-19 have increased among infants. So we agreed that schools in the national capital will not reopen as of now. Before further orders, they will continue to be closed,' Sisodia said. Infections in India are now up to 8 million with 43,893 new cases. In the last 24 hours, as many as 508 deaths were confirmed, bringing the toll to 1,20,010. 6,10,803 of the 79,90,322 cases are new diseases, while 72,59,509 have been discharged. For the fifth consecutive day, Kerala is the top contributor to cases

      THE RACE WINS SLOWLY AND STEADILY; EARLY USE OF THE CORONAVIRUS VACCINE MAY BE DANGEROUS, RESERACHERS SUGGESTS

      It might not be a smart idea to hurry to plan and implement a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. Scientists have cautioned it could lead to a "inferior Covid vaccine". A paper in the Guardian said that "early adoption of a Covid-19 vaccine with moderate efficacy could hinder attempts to develop and produce improved versions." Nothing less than a risk is immunisation against the novel coronavirus or Covid-19 â€” with sensitive communities such as the elderly in mind. Scientists have cautioned that vaccines prepared using slower techniques could be safer than those developed using faster techniques. In addition , in the case of disadvantaged people, they have indicated that "caution would be needed." According to scientists, as researchers fail to determine the "right versions for multiple disadvantaged populations," the study said, "a major misunderstanding." The Guardian article cited Professor Adam Finn of the University of Bristol as saying: "The vaccines that come out the best are the most creative. It is likely that they will not be all that great and that others-produced with more tried-and - tested but slower approaches-might be stronger" "But if many people have already been given the first vaccine, making the argument will become very complicated."
